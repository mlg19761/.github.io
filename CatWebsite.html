		<p>Oh! I spread my love like thick butter <br>

		Over words and chocolate and rain &#8208; <br>

		But it is my somnolent cat that holds my heart, <br>

		For reasons obscure and logic arcane. <br>

		He toys with my heart in his fluffy, puffy paws,<br>

		Hunts it down halls and catches it midair<br>

		Commanding, compelling, adorably distinguished &#8208;<br>

		Mine is an infatuation beyond compare.<br>

		I mock his silly antics and his continuous confusion,<br>

		Yet for him I never lose respect<br>

		For I know that in our household hierarchy<br>

		He is the king &#8208; I merely a subject.<br>

		With an air of pretension and two eyes of pure gold,<br>

		He nonchalantly strides through the hallways<br>

		I stroke him and I kiss him and in him I confide<br>

		Oh! I shall love him always! </p>
